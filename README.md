A simple image viewer



To create this image viewer we utilized pygames and the pil library.
To create the filters we used a large variety of ways that range from, finding the average of pixels to mutiplying elements in the tuples by different percentages.

Here are a list of filters created by group memebers:
Cesa: 
whaleBlueFiltere()
yellowDayFilter()
Alston:
tieDye()
BlackandWhite()
crayon()
Hannah:
glacierBlue()
